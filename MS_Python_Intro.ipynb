        "Over the course of the following chapter, we will give you a quick introduction to Python, and some general tools you will probably find useful to know about. This tutorial is designed to be quick to complete. If you feel uncertain about some aspects of Python (maybe you're new to programming or find Python weird), that's no problem. There is a plethora of online tutorials for Python which are quite good.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now for some general rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "1) As people have different levels of prior knowledge about programming, some of you may find the following tasks to be extremely easy. If that is the case for you, you can skip any and all of the tasks in this notebook that you don't feel you need and immediately jump to \"Chapter 1: An introduction to PyTorch\".\n",
        "2) *No question is stupid*. If you don't know how something works, step 1 is to try and formulate your problem as a google search, and see if someone else asked the same question that you have. Usually they have. If you still cannot find an answer, or the problem is difficult to google search, feel free to talk to any of the PhDs supervising the course. That's what we're here for. Similarly, if you have a question about something in these prepared notebooks, ask it. We are not perfect and neither are the tutorials, so chances are that some things warrant additional explanation by us, or are even a little wrong.\n",
        "3) Experiment. Try to take apart the code and put it back together. The more you actually do instead of only read, the more will the solution stick in your memory. Counterintuitively, this is particularly true if you *don't* understand what the code you just executed actually does. One of the best ways to learn is to take apart someone elses code and reassemble it, or think of a small, private project that you want to do and try to realize it in Python. Learning by doing.\n",
        "4) If you ever find yourself thinking \"This should be a really common use case\", it probably is. Try to express what you want in terms of Python lingo and you will almost certainly find what you are looking for on Google and Stackoverflow. Most of the time, it is even already a single function or class in a package you already have. Finding out about features in this way is basically the norm, rather than the exception."

        "Python is a high-level language, built on C. This means that in Python it is, usually, comparatively easy to get started and code *something* which works. The downside is that performance occasionally suffers a little bit. Most machine learning nowadays is done in Python, but the underlying code (that runs \"under the hood\" so to speak) is implemented in faster languages (C, C++, etc.). Thankfully, some very talented programmers have already done the hard part of creating extremely fast basic math operations running on the GPUs, and we only need to write the comparatively easy Python code. Eventually, the Python code actually makes use of their code, which means that we get the best of both worlds - easy code and fast/efficient implementation.\n",
